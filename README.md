# Stopwatch Tasks

### Assignment:

1. Write a Stopwatch class that can be used to compute elapsed time.
Use the package stopwatch for the source code.

2. Write 5 tasks as described here and use Stopwatch to time each one.

3. Explain the results of running the 5 tasks.

## Description

I ran the tasks on a Microsoft Surface Pro (of course),

You can run the tasks on <a href="stopwatch/Main.java"> Main.java </a> (an also can change the pameter of mine)

## Results

I got these results:

------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:
Sum an array of 10,000,000 double values                                | 0.018423 sec
Sum an array of 10,000,000 Double objects                               | 0.147082 sec
Sum an array of 10,000,000 BigDecimal objects                           | 0.262506 sec
the Unicode characters from (char)65 to (char)65,000                    | 0.000379 sec
the Unicode characters from (char)65 to (char)65,000 ,use StringBuilder | 0.000229 sec

## Explanation of Results
